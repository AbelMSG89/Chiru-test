# Copilot Instructions for Chiru Frontend

## Architecture and Structure

- The project is a frontend for an e‚Äëcommerce site built with **Astro.js** (hybrid SSG/SSR) and **React** for interactive components.
- It follows the **Atomic Design** pattern: components are organized into `atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`, and `templates/` under the `components` directory.
- Routing is file-based under `pages`, with built‚Äëin multi‚Äëlanguage support via `[locale]/`.
- The main layouts live in `layouts` (e.g. `Layout.astro` for general pages and `DocsLayout.astro` for documentation), both using explicit prop typing.

### Astro

> Astro is an all‚Äëin‚Äëone web framework for building websites.

- Astro uses an island architecture and server‚Äëfirst design to minimize client‚Äëside JavaScript and deliver high‚Äëperformance sites.
- Its content‚Äëfocused features‚Äîlike content collections and built‚Äëin Markdown support‚Äîmake it ideal for blogs, marketing sites, and e‚Äëcommerce.
- The `.astro` templating syntax provides robust server rendering in an HTML‚Äëstandard format that feels familiar to JSX users.
- Astro supports popular UI frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, Solid) through official integrations.
- Powered by Vite, Astro offers a fast dev server, automatic bundling of JS/CSS, and an enjoyable development experience.

## üåê Internationalization

- The i18n system supports Spanish, English, and Chinese, with smart fallbacks and automatic browser‚Äëlanguage detection.
- Translations are stored in `i18n` and accessed via hooks/utilities (`useLocalizePage`, `getStaticLanguagePaths`).
- Translation key types are auto‚Äëgenerated for autocomplete and type safety.

## üé® Styling

- Uses **Tailwind CSS 4.x** via a Vite plugin, imported in `global.css`.
- The `cntl` utility (`cntl.ts`) composes Tailwind classes in a readable, conditional way.
- Documentation‚Äëspecific styles live in `docs.css`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflows and Commands

- **Development:** `npm run dev`
- **Build:** `npm run build`
- **Preview:** `npm run preview`
- **Formatting:** `npm run format` and `npm run format:check`
- Both build and preview use Astro to generate static HTML, hydrating React only where needed.

## Conventions and Patterns

- React components hydrate with directives like `client:load`, `client:visible`, etc.
- Layouts use explicit prop typing (`interface Props { ... }`).
- Absolute imports use the `@/` alias (configured in `tsconfig.json`).
- `.astro` files accept typed props and named slots.
- The `index.astro` file automatically redirects based on the user‚Äôs preferred language.

## Extensions and Configuration

- Recommended VS¬†Code extensions are listed in `extensions.json` (Astro, Tailwind, Prettier, JSON Synchronizer, etc.).
- Prettier is set as the default formatter, with support for `.astro` files.
- Editor color settings and other preferences are specified in `settings.json`.
